This is a brochure for students interested in the Louisiana Tech University Costa Rica study abroad program created for my ENGL 303 Technical Writing class.

This project was split amongst eight people: 2 researchers, 1 interviewer, 2 writers, 2 designers, and 1 presenter. I played the role of writer which entailed taking information gathered by the researchers and interviewer and using them to construct cohesive points featured in the final document.
