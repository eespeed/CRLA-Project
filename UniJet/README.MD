UniJet is a rideshare web application that fills the gap which other apps of similar function fail to address. With UniJet's focus on small college towns, students are connected to each other in a way that allows them to take action against communal problems such as limited on-campus parking and the lack of a means of transportation for students without vehicles. Users in need of a ride around town are able to request a driver in a seamless transaction that benefits both parties. With the scheduler feature, riders and drivers with compatible schedules are automatically recommended to each other allowing for a convenient connection. After the connection is made, both parties will exchange phone numbers in case they need to stay in contact, and a live route to the other user will be displayed. After the rider has been picked up and dropped off, both users will be given the option to rate the other in order to maintain a healthy and safe environment for future users.
